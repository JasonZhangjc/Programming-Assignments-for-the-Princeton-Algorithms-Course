# Programming Assignment 1 & 2 for the course Algorithm Part I held by the Princeton University on Coursera
The PERCOLATION is the first programming assignment.

The QUEUES is the second programming assignment.

This is a demo for how to use them.
 
To run the project:
 1. You cannot compile or run the programs on your computer.
 2. You can only submit them to the course website on Coursera.
 3. Submit a zip file named percolation.zip that contains only the two source files Percolation.java and PercolationStats.java.
 4. Submit a zip file named queues-submit.zip that contains only the three source files Deque.java, RandomizedQueue.java, and Permutation.java.
